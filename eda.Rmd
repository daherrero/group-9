## Data Description

### Provenance
We obtained our datasets from basketball-reference.com and stats.nba.com.
We used the R package `nbastatR` to obtain the data from those websites.

### Unit of observation and Variables
Our unit of observation is a player during one season.
Our original dataset consists of 21235 observations  and 75 variables, but 
we've reduced this number to 11695 observations after selecting seasons
after 1983 and players that have played in at least 30 games in the season.
We've also taken out some unnecessary variables to make a 11695 observation,
64 variable dataset.

```{r, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
players <- bref_players_stats(seasons = 1950:2020, tables = c("advanced", "per_game"), include_all_nba = TRUE)
players_post1984 <- filter(players, yearSeason >= 1984) %>%
  filter(countGames > 29)
```
